# JobScraper
This application scrapes job listings and organizes them, enabling search and retrieval.
Ah! Got it — you want a **README-style document written in plain text** (not just code blocks) that reads like instructions someone can follow. Here's a clean version you can copy into a README file:

## Step 1 — Setup Git

Before starting, make sure Git is installed on your machine. You can check by opening a terminal and running:

```
git --version
```

If Git is installed, it will display the version number.

Next, configure your Git identity by setting your username and email:

```
git config --global user.name "Gaël Thomas"
git config --global user.email "example@mail.com"
```

This ensures that your commits are properly attributed to you.

## Step 2 — Clone Your GitHub Repository

1. Create a repository on GitHub if you haven’t already.
2. Copy the HTTPS URL of your repository.
3. Open VS Code (or your preferred terminal) and clone the repository using:

```
git clone https://github.com/Tierney/JobScraper.git
```

This command creates a local copy of your repository in your workspace.

4. Navigate into your repository folder:

```
cd
 JobScraper
```

5. You can list the files in the repository to see its contents:

```
ls: contents of file
cd: open folder
cd .. go back a golder
nano: open file
Ctrl + X: save file
